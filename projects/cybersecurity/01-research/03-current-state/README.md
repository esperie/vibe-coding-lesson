# Current State of Cybersecurity (2025-2026)

## Overview

This research collection documents the current state of cybersecurity as of January 2025, compiled for professionals joining government cybersecurity units. The landscape is characterized by unprecedented threat activity, rapid technological change, significant workforce challenges, and evolving regulatory frameworks.

## Executive Summary

### Key Statistics at a Glance

| Metric | Value | Trend |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Global Cybercrime Costs | $10.5 trillion annually | +15% YoY |
| Ransomware Victims (2025) | 7,515+ claimed victims | +53-63% YoY |
| Cybersecurity Workforce Gap | 4.8 million unfilled roles | +19% YoY |
| Average Data Breach Cost (US) | $10 million | 2x global average |
| Organizations Reporting Skills Gaps | 90% | Stable |
| Nation-State Threat Groups Tracked | 600+ | Growing |

### Critical Trends

1. **AI-Powered Attacks**: 82.6% of phishing emails now use AI-generated content; deepfake fraud incidents have reached $25.6M per incident
2. **Ransomware Evolution**: 58% increase in attacks in 2025; 124 distinct named groups operating
3. **Nation-State Activity**: China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea intensifying operations against critical infrastructure
4. **Quantum Computing**: "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" attacks underway; PQC migration urgency increasing
5. **Regulatory Expansion**: DORA, NIS2, CIRCIA creating new compliance requirements globally

## Key Implications for Government Cybersecurity Professionals

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Threat Intelligence**: Understanding nation-state TTPs and critical infrastructure targeting
2. **Incident Response**: Preparing for AI-enhanced attacks and faster attack cycles
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Navigating CIRCIA requirements and harmonization efforts
4. **Workforce Development**: Addressing skills gaps through certification and continuous learning

### Strategic Considerations

1. **Post-Quantum Readiness**: Begin cryptographic inventory and migration planning
2. **Zero Trust Implementation**: Essential for both cloud and on-premises environments
3. **AI Security**: Both leveraging AI for defense and defending against AI-powered attacks
4. **Supply Chain Security**: Critical for both technology and OT environments
