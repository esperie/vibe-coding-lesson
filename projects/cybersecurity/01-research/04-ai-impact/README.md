# AI/ML/GenAI/Agentic Impact on Cybersecurity

## Executive Summary

This research documentation provides a comprehensive analysis of how artificial intelligence, machine learning, generative AI, and agentic AI systems are transforming the cybersecurity landscape. Prepared for personnel joining a government cybersecurity unit, this resource covers both offensive and defensive applications of AI in cybersecurity, with particular emphasis on developments in 2025-2026.

## Key Findings

### The AI Cybersecurity Arms Race

The cybersecurity landscape has fundamentally transformed as AI systems now operate on both sides of the security equation:

| Metric | 2024 | 2025-2026 | Trend |
|--------|------|-----------|-------|
| AI-powered phishing campaigns | Emerging | 76.4% use polymorphic tactics | Exponential growth |
| Organizations with AI security tools | 51% | 74% mid-to-large enterprises | Rapid adoption |
| Deepfake-enabled vishing | Baseline | +1,600% Q1 2025 | Critical threat |
| AI-driven attacks as share of threat landscape | ~20% | 50% projected | Dominant concern |
| Global AI cybersecurity market | $24.8B | $146.5B by 2034 | 6x growth |

### Critical Threat Assessment

**Immediate Threats (2025-2026):**
- AI-generated phishing at scale (10,000 personalized emails/second capability)
- Deepfake-as-a-Service (DaaS) enabling CEO fraud and voice cloning
- Polymorphic malware evading 70%+ of traditional detection
- Autonomous AI attacks with minimal human oversight documented

**Emerging Threats (2026-2030):**
- Data poisoning attacks on AI training pipelines
- Agentic AI system compromise through prompt injection
- Quantum computing threats to cryptographic systems
- Brain-computer interface vulnerabilities

### Defensive Capabilities

Government and private sector responses are advancing rapidly:
- NIST Cyber AI Profile (draft 2025, final 2026)
- NATO Integrated Cyber Defence Centre launched
- AI-powered SIEM/XDR reducing alert noise by 50-90%
- Mean time to detect (MTTD) reduced from hours to seconds with AI
