### 1.2 Eligibility Requirements

**Basic Requirements**:
- U.S. citizenship (required)
- Meet the 13 adjudicative guidelines
- Pass background investigation
- No disqualifying factors

### 1.3 The 13 Adjudicative Guidelines

| Guideline | Area | Concerns |
|-----------|------|----------|
| A | Allegiance to the United States | Foreign preference, dual citizenship |
| B | Foreign Influence | Foreign contacts, property |
| C | Foreign Preference | Acting to prefer foreign government |
| D | Sexual Behavior | Behavior that could compromise |
| E | Personal Conduct | Dishonesty, rule violations |
| F | Financial Considerations | Debt, bankruptcy, gambling |

## 4. Chain of Custody for Evidence

Chain of custody ensures the integrity and reliability of digital evidence from collection through legal proceedings.

### 4.1 Definition and Importance

> "The chain of custody in cybersecurity is a critical sequence of steps designed to ensure the integrity and reliability of digital evidence from the moment it is collected until it is presented in a legal setting."

**Why It Matters**:
- Ensures evidence admissibility in court
- Prevents tampering claims
- Maintains investigation integrity
- Supports prosecution of cybercriminals

**Current Context**:
> "Digital evidence now appears in over 90% of criminal cases."

### 4.2 Key Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Integrity** | Evidence unchanged from collection |
| **Authenticity** | Evidence is what it claims to be |
| **Completeness** | All relevant evidence preserved |
| **Continuity** | Unbroken custody record |
| **Documentation** | Every transfer recorded |

### 4.3 Chain of Custody Process

```

### 4.4 Evidence Handling Steps

#### Step 1: Collection
**Requirements**:
- Use write-blockers for storage devices
- Create forensic images, not work on originals
- Document collection method and conditions
- Photograph physical evidence
- Record date, time, location, collector

**Tools**:
| Tool Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Write Blockers | Prevent evidence modification |
| Forensic Imaging | Bit-for-bit copies |
| Hash Algorithms | Verify integrity (MD5, SHA-256) |
| Photography | Document physical state |

#### Step 2: Documentation
**Required Information**:
- Evidence description
- Date and time collected
- Collector identification
- Collection method
- Location of collection
- Initial condition
- Unique identifier/tag

#### Step 3: Storage
**Requirements**:
- Secure, access-controlled environment
- Environmental controls (temperature, humidity)
- Limited access to authorized personnel
- Logging of all access attempts
- Regular integrity verification

#### Step 4: Transfer
**Documentation Requirements**:
- Date and time of transfer
- Transferring party identification
- Receiving party identification
- Reason for transfer
- Signatures of both parties
- Condition at transfer

#### Step 5: Presentation
**Court Requirements**:
- Complete, unbroken chain documented
- All handlers identified
- No gaps in custody
- Integrity verified (hash matches)

### 4.5 Digital Evidence Challenges

**Unique Challenges**:
| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Volatility | Evidence can be easily altered |
| Invisibility | No physical trace of copying |
| Volume | Massive amounts of data |
| Cloud Evidence | Data not physically possessed |
| Encryption | May prevent access |
| Anti-forensics | Deliberate evidence destruction |

**Cloud Evidence Considerations**:
> "Cloud-based evidence such as emails, documents and user activity... adds complexity to maintaining the chain of custody because a copy is made from the original source which is usually an email server or cloud drive."

### 4.6 Consequences of Broken Chain

| Consequence | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Evidence Exclusion | Courts rule evidence inadmissible |
| Case Dismissal | Prosecution fails |
| Legal Repercussions | Personnel face scrutiny/discipline |
| Credibility Loss | Investigation integrity compromised |
| Future Impact | Affects subsequent cases |

### 4.7 Emerging Technologies

**Blockchain for Chain of Custody**:
> "LOCARD is an EU-funded project providing a platform where evidence metadata is stored on a blockchain. If evidence is logged or transferred, the transaction is added to the blockchain and any attempt to tamper with it will be evident."

**Smart Contract Access Control**:
- Immutable access records
- Transparent custody history
- Automated verification
- Non-repudiation of transfers

### 4.8 Best Practices

1. **Always use forensic images**, never original evidence
2. **Document everything** in real-time
3. **Calculate hashes** immediately after collection and at every transfer
4. **Limit handlers** to essential personnel
5. **Use standardized forms** (NIST Sample CoC)
6. **Train all personnel** in proper procedures
7. **Maintain secure storage** with access logging
8. **Regular audits** of evidence handling procedures

### 4.9 DFIR Integration

**Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)**:
> "During the DFIR process, incident responders use forensic techniques to collect and preserve digital evidence while they're containing and eradicating a threat. This ensures that the chain of custody is followed and valuable evidence isn't altered or destroyed by incident response efforts."
