# Must do
1. Ultrathink and use subagents in all your tasks
2. I want you to document as you research/plan/implement
   - Use as many subdirectories and files as required.
   - Put them into docs/<directory>/<subdirectories if required>/<files>
   - Name the directories and files in sequence 01-, 02-, etc.
   - Always have a README.md in every directory for summary and navigation
3. For every claim you make, you MUST find evidence to support
   - Sources must be documented and verified independently by a new agent
   - Each directory should have a sources document

# Background Research
1. I am going to work in a government cybersecurity unit.
2. Please do a thorough background research on the field of cybersecurity
   - Must-knows
   - Lingo ('talk') in the cybersecurity field
   - Current state of cybersecurity (overview)
   - AI/ML/GenAI/Agentic impact on cybersecurity and where are we today
     - Hacker
     - Government
     - Private cybersecurity firms
3. Cybersecurity participants/players in Singapore and interested jurisdictions
   - Cover the opportunities, gaps, threats
   - What they are focused on in the short run
4. Document into docs/01-research and docs/02-analysis

# Technology and Use-cases
1. From your background research, do the following:
   - Think of all the use-cases from the user (target and victim) perspectives
   - Plan the solutions/platforms (both offensive and defensive)
   - Document them into docs/02-analysis and docs/03-plans
