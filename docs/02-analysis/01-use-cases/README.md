## Executive Summary

This documentation provides a multi-perspective analysis of cybersecurity use-cases, examining how attacks unfold from both the defender and attacker viewpoints. Understanding these perspectives is essential for developing effective security strategies, incident response capabilities, and defensive architectures.

### Key Findings

| Perspective | Primary Concerns | Critical Use-Cases |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Enterprise** | Business continuity, data protection, regulatory compliance | Ransomware, BEC, supply chain attacks |
| **Individual** | Identity theft, financial fraud, privacy violation | Phishing, credential theft, social engineering |
| **Government** | National security, critical infrastructure, public trust | APT campaigns, espionage, infrastructure attacks |
| **Attacker** | Financial gain, strategic advantage, ideological goals | RaaS operations, data exfiltration, disruption |
