## Risk-Based Prioritization

### Overview

With thousands of vulnerabilities discovered, risk-based prioritization is essential. CVSS alone is insufficient; context matters.

### CVSS Limitations

| CVSS Challenge | Impact |
|----------------|--------|
| Static score | Doesn't reflect current exploitation |
| No asset context | All systems treated equally |
| No business context | No consideration of business impact |
| Exploit availability | Not reflected in base score |

### Enhanced Prioritization Frameworks

#### Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS)

**Description**: FIRST-managed model predicting exploitation probability.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Output** | Probability score (0-1) of exploitation in next 30 days |
| **Basis** | ML model on historical exploitation data |
| **Updates** | Daily score updates |

**Usage**:

| EPSS Score | Priority | Action |
|------------|----------|--------|
| > 0.5 | Critical | Immediate remediation |
| 0.1 - 0.5 | High | Rapid remediation |
| 0.01 - 0.1 | Medium | Standard SLA |
| < 0.01 | Low | Opportunistic |

**Government Use Case**: Prioritization enhancement, reducing alert fatigue.

---

#### CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)

**Description**: Authoritative catalog of actively exploited vulnerabilities.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Source** | CISA (mandatory for US federal) |
| **Criteria** | CVE assigned, active exploitation, remediation available |
| **Updates** | Continuous additions |

**Integration**:
- Import KEV into VM platform
- Auto-escalate KEV vulnerabilities
- Track KEV remediation separately

**Government Use Case**: Mandatory priority for confirmed exploitation, alignment with international partners.

| **Tier 3: Medium** | Internal systems | Internal apps, file servers | 0.5 |
| **Tier 4: Low** | Development, test | Dev environments, sandboxes | 0.2 |

### Singapore-Specific Prioritization

| Context | Priority Adjustment |
|---------|-------------------|
| CII system | +25% priority |
| Internet-facing | +20% priority |
| Contains NRIC/PII | +15% priority |
| OT/ICS | +20% priority (different remediation path) |
| GCC-hosted | Standard priority |
