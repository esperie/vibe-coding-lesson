### EU Transfer Mechanisms

#### Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)

- Pre-approved legal templates
- Required for exports to countries without adequacy decision
- Must include supplementary measures where needed

#### Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)

- Internal, regulator-approved policies
- Authorize data movement within multinational enterprises
- Require regulatory approval

#### Adequacy Decisions

**Current Status:**

| Country | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| UK | Extended to 2031 | EDPB Opinion 2025/26 |
| Brazil | Draft approved | EDPB positive opinion October 2025 |
| Japan | Adequate | Mutual recognition |
| South Korea | Adequate | - |

**UK Adequacy Extension (October 2025):**
- EDPB adopted Opinion 2025/26
- UK continues to maintain "essentially equivalent" protection to GDPR
- Extension to 2031

**Brazil Draft Adequacy (September 2025):**
- Commission published draft adequacy decision
- EDPB adopted positive opinion (October 2025)

### China: Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL)

#### Transfer Requirements

Transfers allowed only if one of three conditions met:
1. Government adequacy approval
2. Standard contracts issued by Chinese authorities
3. Passing government cybersecurity review

#### Practical Impact

- Companies sending data out of China must perform detailed security assessments
- May need Chinese regulatory approval before export
- Data localization often required

### AI and Cross-Border Data

#### EDPB Confirmation

GDPR applies to AI model training:
- Any model trained on EU personal data must meet lawful processing standards
- Cross-border transfer requirements apply regardless of location

#### Risk Projection

**Gartner Forecast:**
By 2027, over **40% of AI-related privacy violations** will result from unintended cross-border data exposure via GenAI tools.

### Key Compliance Mechanisms Summary

| Mechanism | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Adequacy Decision | EC determination of adequate protection | Transfers to approved countries |
| Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) | Pre-approved contract templates | Most common mechanism |
| Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) | Internal corporate policies | Multinational groups |
| Explicit Consent | User authorization | Specific transfers |
