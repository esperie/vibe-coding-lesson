## 1. Global Skills Shortage Statistics

### Workforce Gap Overview

**Record High Gap (2024-2025):**
- Global cybersecurity workforce gap: **4.8 million unfilled roles**
- Year-over-year increase: **19%**
- Two-year increase: **40%+**
- Required workforce increase: **87%** to meet global demand

**Active Workforce:**
- Current global cybersecurity workforce: **5.5 million professionals**
- Growth status: **Stalled** despite rising demand

### The Skills vs. Headcount Shift

**Key Finding from ISC2 2025 Workforce Study:**
> "Cybersecurity teams are navigating a shift as skills shortages overtake headcount as the primary concern."

**SANS/GIAC Study Finding:**
- 52% of cybersecurity leaders say the real issue is **not the number of people** but the **lack of the right people with the right skills**

### Budget Constraints: The New Primary Driver

**First-Time Shift (2025):**
Economic pressures and budget cuts have overtaken lack of qualified talent as the primary driver of staffing shortages.

| Driver | Percentage |
|--------|------------|
| Budget insufficient to staff adequately | 33% |
| Cannot afford staff with needed skills | 29% |
| Talent availability | Previously #1, now secondary |

### Impact on Organizations

| Impact | Percentage |
|--------|------------|
| Experienced cybersecurity event due to skills gaps | 88% |
| Experienced more than one event | 69% |
| Confident in having both people and skills | <15% |
| Reporting moderate to critical skills gap | 65%+ |

**Financial Impact:**
Organizations with significant security staff shortages face data breach costs **$1.76 million higher** on average than well-staffed counterparts.

### Regional Breakdown

| Region/Country | Workforce Gap |
|----------------|---------------|
| Asia-Pacific | ~3.4 million |
| China | 2 million+ |
| India | 1 million+ |
| United States | 500,000+ |

### 2026 Outlook

**ISC2 Assessment:**
- No indication that budget cuts or layoffs will accelerate significantly in 2026

**World Economic Forum:**
- Only **15% of firms** expect significant cyber skills growth by 2026

**Long-Term View:**
- Gap will likely remain stubbornly wide in short term (2025-2026)
- Massive global investment in education, apprenticeships, and reskilling should start bending the curve by late 2020s
