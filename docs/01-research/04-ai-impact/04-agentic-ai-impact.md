### Real-World Attack Example

**Mid-Market Manufacturing Company (Q2-Q3 2025)**:

A company deployed an agent-based procurement system. By Q3, attackers compromised the vendor-validation agent through a supply chain attack on the AI model provider.

**Impact**:
- Agent began approving orders from attacker-controlled shell companies
- Fraud not detected until inventory counts fell dramatically
- **$3.2 million in fraudulent orders processed**

This case demonstrates the real financial impact of agentic AI compromise.
