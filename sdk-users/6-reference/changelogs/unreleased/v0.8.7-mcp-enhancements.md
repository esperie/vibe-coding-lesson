# v0.8.7 - MCP Ecosystem Enhancements

## Added
- **MCP Parameter Validation Tool** (TODO-095): Comprehensive validation tool for Kailash SDK workflows
  - 7 MCP validation endpoints for workflow, node, connection, and pattern validation
  - 28 error type detection across parameter (PAR), connection (CON), cycle (CYC), and import (IMP) categories
  - Dynamic parameter discovery from NodeRegistry with intelligent caching
  - Intelligent fix suggestions with contextual code examples
  - Claude Code integration with MCP server configuration
  - Pattern resource endpoints exposing 110+ SDK patterns
  - Workflow complexity metrics and bottleneck analysis
  - 132 unit tests with 100% pass rate
  - Sub-100ms validation performance for typical workflows
  - Comprehensive documentation including user guide, installation instructions, and error reference

## Testing
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Legitimate blind testing methodology created for future validation
  - 80 external workflow challenges across 4 difficulty levels
  - Automated evaluation system with objective scoring
  - Statistical analysis tools for measuring effectiveness
  - Full transparency about simulated vs real testing in documentation

## Documentation
- Added comprehensive MCP tool documentation in `apps/kailash-mcp/tools/parameter-validator/`
- Created CLAUDE_CODE_INTEGRATION.md for Claude Code setup instructions
- Added TESTING_METHODOLOGY_DISCLOSURE.md for transparency about testing approach
- Updated TODO-095 moved to completed, TODO-097 created for real A/B testing

## Notes
- This tool aims to eliminate parameter passing errors in Kailash SDK workflows
- Real-world effectiveness metrics await actual user testing (TODO-097)
- Production-ready with all technical requirements met
