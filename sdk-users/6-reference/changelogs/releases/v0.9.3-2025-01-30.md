# Release v0.9.3 - ParallelRuntime Test Fix

**Date**: 2025-01-30
**Version**: 0.9.3
**Type**: Patch Release

## 🎉 Overview
This patch release fixes a misleading test case and ensures proper validation of parallel execution functionality.

## 🚀 Key Highlights
- Fixed misleading `test_parallel_execution_with_merge` to use actual ParallelRuntime instead of LocalRuntime
- Improved test accuracy for parallel execution validation
- Enhanced documentation of parallel vs sequential execution behavior

## 📊 By The Numbers
- Tests: 1 test fixed
- Test accuracy improvements: 100% for parallel execution validation
- All TODO-128 cycle convergence work remains stable

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Parallel Execution Test Fix
The test `test_parallel_execution_with_merge` was incorrectly using `LocalRuntime` (sequential execution) while being named and intended for parallel execution testing. This has been corrected to:

```python
# Before: Sequential execution with misleading name
def test_parallel_execution_with_merge(self, runtime):  # runtime = LocalRuntime
    # ... sequential execution ...

# After: Actual parallel execution
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_parallel_execution_with_merge(self):
    parallel_runtime = ParallelRuntime(max_workers=4, debug=True)
    results, run_id = await parallel_runtime.execute(workflow.build())
```

### Validation Improvements
- Test now demonstrates true concurrent node scheduling
- Realistic timing expectations for async execution overhead
- Proper verification of parallel execution behavior

## 🔄 Migration Guide
No migration required. This is a test infrastructure improvement that doesn't affect SDK API or functionality.

## 📚 Documentation
- Test now serves as accurate example of ParallelRuntime usage
- Debug logs clearly show concurrent node scheduling

## 📋 Complete Changelog

### Fixed
- `test_parallel_execution_with_merge` now uses ParallelRuntime for actual parallel execution instead of LocalRuntime
- Corrected timing assertions to account for async execution overhead
- Fixed linting issues in test files (boolean comparisons, formatting)

### Technical
- Improved test accuracy for parallel execution validation
- Enhanced debug logging to show concurrent node scheduling
- All TODO-128 cycle convergence fixes remain stable and verified

## 🛡️ Stability
All existing functionality remains stable. This release only improves test accuracy and doesn't change any runtime behavior for end users.
