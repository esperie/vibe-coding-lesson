# Kailash SDK v0.9.6 Release Notes
**Release Date:** January 31, 2025
**Type:** Patch Release (Bug Fixes)

## 🚨 Critical Bug Fixes

### IterativeLLMAgentNode Fallback Architecture
**Issue:** IterativeLLMAgentNode was executing in 0.0s with zero output when no MCP servers were configured
- **Root Cause:** Missing fallback mechanism for non-MCP scenarios
- **Fix:** Implemented proper fallback architecture with direct LLM execution
- **Impact:** Resolves critical production issue where workflows would silently fail
- **Files:** `src/kailash/nodes/ai/iterative_llm_agent.py`

### Enhanced W8 Serialization for Platform Compatibility
**Issue:** Node serialization failing on platforms expecting .to_dict() methods
- **Root Cause:** `Node._is_json_serializable()` didn't recognize objects with .to_dict() methods
- **Fix:** Enhanced serialization logic to detect and utilize .to_dict() methods
- **Impact:** Improves compatibility with Nexus platform and other serialization contexts
- **Files:** `src/kailash/nodes/base.py`

## 🔧 Technical Details

### IterativeLLMAgentNode Enhancement
```python
# Before: Silent failure when no MCP servers available
# After: Proper fallback execution with direct LLM calls
```

### W8 Serialization Enhancement
```python
# Enhanced Node._is_json_serializable() method
# Now recognizes objects with .to_dict() methods for better platform integration
```
