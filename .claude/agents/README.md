# Kailash SDK Focused Subagents

This directory contains focused subagents designed to replace the token-heavy feature-implementation.md workflow with efficient specialists that operate in separate context windows.

## Focused Subagent Architecture

The subagents are designed around the core workflow phases identified in `CLAUDE.md` and `feature-implementation.md`:

### Critical Integration Guides

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: DataFlow + Nexus Integration**
- See: `sdk-users/guides/dataflow-nexus-integration.md` for tested configurations
- Key settings to prevent blocking: `Nexus(auto_discovery=False)` + `DataFlow(enable_model_persistence=False)`
- Full featured config available with 10-30s startup time
- Both specialists updated with integration warnings

### Design Principles

1. **Navigation over Loading**: Agents use file indexes rather than loading entire contexts
2. **Focused Expertise**: Each agent has a specific, narrow domain of expertise
3. **Reference-Based**: Agents provide specific file paths and references
4. **Workflow-Aligned**: Agents map to the established development workflow phases

## Coordination Through Root CLAUDE.md

Since subagents cannot invoke other subagents, coordination happens at the main Claude Code level through the root `CLAUDE.md` file, which:

1. **Loads automatically** when Claude Code starts
2. **Contains the 18-step enterprise workflow** for guidance
3. **References subagents** for specific phases
4. **Maintains the multi-step strategy** that users follow

## File References
